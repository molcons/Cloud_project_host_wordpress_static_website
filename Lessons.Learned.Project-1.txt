# LESSONS LEARNED 

VPC 
During my setup of the VPC, I tried to connect to an instance via the AWS CLI, but it would not work. 
After troubleshooting, I realized my choice of the non-default region [ us-east-2 instead of east-1] 
meant that I needed to add addition arguments to my command to make it work, specifically â€“
aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --region us-east-2 --instance-id i-0174ed1fded208cb1

Also, the project architecture helped me to better understand the relationships of security groups.

EFS / RDS
When preparing for the project, I used a private password for the RDS inside the AWS console, 
but later I changed it to a generic one. The instructions require hard coding the password into the WP config file. 
Therefore, a generic password was substituted for the project, as the config file can be viewed by others. 

DNS / ASG / SSL certs
During the project, a sole EC2 instance is used to test the WordPress install. 
Manual adjustments are made to the config file, allowing HTTPS. However, when switching to ASG and an EC2 template, 
those manual configs were no longer present, thus the site would only display in http. 
So, I manually configured the live ec2 instances with the needed adjustment, so that https functioned. 

/* SSL Settings */
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);

// Get true SSL status from AWS load balancer
if(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO']) && $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] === 'https') {
  $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = '1';
}
In a normal deployment, the ec2 template would need the config file saved and accessible to the template, 
so that all scaled ec2 instances have secure https access.
